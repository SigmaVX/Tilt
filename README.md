## Description

Tilt is a MERN stack application which provides a way to report online gaming cheaters. With the growth of the online gaming industry, video game cheating has evolved and acquired various forms. Aimbot, wallhack cheats, as well as network manipulation, and account recovery are but a few of the ways gaming cheaters alter results. To address this core issue, which will likely expand in the near future, the Tilt app provides a detailed reporting system that tracks online game cheaters, their methods, and their frequency among other valuable pieces of data. 

In addition, Tilt includes a social media interface through which users can share relevant videos on gamecheats. There is also a chat feature; users can join "cheat chat" forums and exchange information.

The Tilt app can be cloned and installed following the procedure below.

1. Now we are ready to clone this app by running the following command. `git clone git@github.com:SigmaVX/Tilt.git` Note that if `git` and `node` need to be installed, the steps to do so are the following: a) git must be installed. [Download git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and b. nodejs must also be installed. [Download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Since this file makes use of several node modules, please run `npm install`.  This installs all of the dependencies. Note that this command will install server side node dependencies as well as client side node packages utilized by react.

3. `Tilt` is a full stack app that uses nodejs and express on the back end. It needs to be deployed to on a platform that provides (like Heroku) "back-end" support. [Guide to deploying a Node Web Server on Heroku](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/RUTSOM201801FSF4-Class-Repository-FSF/blob/master/13-express/Supplemental/HerokuGuide.md)

4. It is also necessary to setup MongoDB for Tilt. This services is provided by mLabs on heroku. In other words, the mLabs dependency needs to be added to the heroku app. Please refer to the following guide available from the heroku developers website.
